# Hourly-bike-rental-demand-prediction
It is based on python and machine learning

This report is about “Hourly bike rental demand prediction” which has been implemented to
predict whether there will be demand for rent or not in the next coming hours.
Since 2009, the public bicycle system has rapid development in India. As the conventional
type, the public bicycle system has fixed rental stations. But since 2016, a large number of
shared bicycles have appeared in many cities in India, namely, public bicycles without fixed
rental stations based on the internet, and related scholars have studied the operation of shared
bicycles. However, the development prospects of shared bicycles in India are now taking
place in a massive scale.
So, for this very purpose I decided to make a project on hourly bike rental demand so that we
will be able to predict the demand and then can make our decisions in accordance with that.
